# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Project Overview
Pewlett-Hackard is needing to prepare for the impending changes to its large workforce. Bobby, the manager, is hoping to prepare the company for expected retirements within the company and to strategize in replacing these positions. I needed to create employee databases and to organize the data to intepret the employee names, birth dates, employment tenures, and employee titles in order to determine which employees will be retiring, how many will be retiring, and strategizing how to facilitate mentoring replacements for the pending vacancies. PostgreSQL and pgAdmin were utilized in order to create data bases and to manipualte imported data. Primary and foreign key data sets were identified and organized in order to join data sets. Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) provided a road map and connection matrix amongst data points that would serve as the foundation for determining our desired final data table that would identify likely retiring employee profiles. Select statements were used to extract data such as age and tenure of employees to help identify the pool of potential retirees and Count was used to identify the size of the pool. Joins were used to tie employee data with workforce data to determine how potential retirements would impact particular departments. Count, Group By, and Order By were used to yield our final results from the joined data tables. Distinct on was used to determine how many retirements were expected per job title and to determine which employees were eligible to participate in the mentorship program. 

## Results
### Deliverable 1
-A combined 90,398 employees are likely to retire.

-The expected number of retirements is 30.13% of the current total workforce. 

-54.51% of expected retirements are from senior level positions.

-45,397 junior and senior engineers are expected to retire, 50.22% of total retirements.

## Summary
Retiring employees in the upcoming years are largely occupying senior positions within the company. This is going to present a few challenges for Bobby as it will take a concerted effort to train and mentor junior employees to fill these roles. Hewlett-Packard will have to consider the direction they wish to take the company in coming years as filling these senior positions will shape the company's culture in the coming years. Identifying potential retiring employees ahead of time will allow the company to benefit from having senior employees pass along their knowledge and skill sets that have contributed to their long tenure and success within the company. Bobby may also want to better understand the characteristics that has led to the success of these employees that will help shape outside hiring decisions by building a desired employee profile. Hewlett-Packard is also going to deal with a significant loss in intellectual capital amongst its junior positions. There are over 41,000 employees that have a wealth of experience that will be retiring and the company will have to develop an approach to provide training to a new wave of employees. Senior positions are likely to be filled by existing junior employees, along with the retirment of these junior retiremenets that will create a shortage of experienced, tenured empooyees in junior positions.  Over half of all expected retirements are in the engineering facet of the company, which will create a signficant loss in technical knowledge. Recruitement and retaining skilled engineers will be increaseingly challenging for Bobby. 
At all levels within the company Bobby will need to prioritize the processes needed to retain the vast experience of its current workforce as they transition into retirement.
